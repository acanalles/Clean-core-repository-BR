## README

Hello, I hope you are very well.

He left them the step-by-step development guides of what we saw during the training.
The guides are created to work with the API sandbox in API.SAP.COM, which is now back online, so they must use the CSV files that are in the guide and not the ones we use in the workshop.
Connections to S4HANA **must also work as API and not as Basic Authentication**, use all as it is in the guide.
The tools system will remain online, but consider that we use it for other demos, so the data is not reliable and if at any time you do not have access it is because we are in training, but in general it should not be long out of line.

I hope this content is useful to you and if you require any type of support, please let us know.

Best regards

Rodrigo Riveros A.
